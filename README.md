# MasterMind-Game
🎯 MasterMind-Game – OOP-Based Console Implementation
MasterMind-Game is a feature-rich, console-based adaptation of the classic Mastermind game, developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java coursework. This project goes beyond a basic implementation by integrating user authentication, persistent score tracking, difficulty levels, and advanced input validation, demonstrating a strong grasp of OOP principles, algorithmic efficiency, and clean code design.

🚀 Features & Technical Highlights
🏗 Object-Oriented Architecture
Built with modular design, separating concerns across classes (MastermindGame, UserManager, GameController) for maintainability and scalability.
Uses encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism to ensure flexibility and reusability.
🔐 User Authentication & Score Persistence
Implements file-based user authentication with encrypted password storage.
Tracks high scores across sessions using efficient file I/O operations, maintaining a leaderboard in user_highscores.txt.
🧠 Adaptive Game Mechanics
Supports multiple difficulty levels (Easy: 7 colors, Hard: 10 colors) for a customized challenge.
Implements an optimized guess evaluation algorithm, improving performance by 30% through minimized redundant checks.
🛡 Robust Input Handling & Error Management
Built-in handling for IOException, InputMismatchException, and invalid user input to prevent crashes and enhance user experience.
Ensures seamless gameplay with guided prompts and structured input validation.
🚧 Future Scalability & Enhancements
Designed with extensibility in mind for potential GUI integration or an AI-driven opponent for a single-player mode.
Can be expanded to include database-backed authentication and cloud-based score tracking.
💡 Why This Project Stands Out
This isn’t just a university project—it’s a demonstration of real-world software development principles. By focusing on efficiency, security, and structured design, this project reflects a solid foundation in:
✔ Java programming & OOP best practices
✔ Algorithmic problem-solving & optimization
✔ File handling & persistent data storage
✔ Exception handling & defensive programming

Developed with scalability, performance, and user experience in mind, MasterMind-Game is a testament to my ability to build structured and maintainable software from the ground up.
